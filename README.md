# PROPOSED QUIRK HANDLING:

considering that the library does not perform any data modification/scaling the best approach to keep the logical separation would be:

0) define Quirk class in the sdk library port
1) specify quirks for scaling some given ids in a 'quirks libary'
2) accept and process quirks in the scripts making use of the library (e.g. homeassistant)

## TODO:

all

## CONCEPT PSEUDOCODE

0) this is the code that defines the quirks, part of the new sdk
```
#define a quirks.py in the sdk library:


class Quirk ...
   self.id = ... #device id to be matched
   #dict: keys are DPCodes, values are dicts of transform (scaling) properties
   self.DPScaling = {DPCode:{	'type':'affine', # linear supports only scale, affine scale and offset, and so on... could even be any invertible lambda function
				'offset':0,
				'scale':1,
				}, ...			
			}

```

1) this is the quirks library
```
#this could be built by an user config file...
quirks = {	qid1:Quirk(...),
		qid2:Quirk(...),
		...
	}
```

2) this is the possible handling of quirks in homeassistant's tuya
```
#handle scaling in entity.py
def scale(value, DPCode, device):
    #check if a quirk definition is present for the current device
    q = quirks[device.id] if device id in quirks.keys() else None
    if q:
        #check if scaling is defined for current DPCode (which here represents a data type of known measurement unit)
        tr = q.DPScaling[DPCode] if DPCode in q.DPScaling.keys() else None
        #handle the type of transform
        if tr:
            if tr['type'] == 'linear':
                value = value/tr.scale
            if tr['type'] == 'affine':
                value = (value-tr.offset)/tr.scale
                # and the def scale_back would be value*tr.scale+tr.offset
    else:
        #do it the usual way
        ...

def scale_back(value, DPCode, device):
    ...

#

```
